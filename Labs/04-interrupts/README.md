### Overflow times

1. Complete table with overflow times.

| **Module** | **Number of bits** | **1** | **8** | **32** | **64** | **128** | **256** | **1024** |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Timer/Counter0 | 8  | 16u | 128u | -- | 1.024m | -- | 4.096m | 16.384m |
| Timer/Counter1 | 16 | 4.096m | 32.768m | -- | 262.144m | -- | 1.049 | 4.194 |
| Timer/Counter2 | 8  | 16u | 128u | 512u | 1.024m | 2.048m | 4.096m | 16.384m |

### Timer library

1. In your words, describe the difference between common C function and interrupt service routine.
   * Function - Functions are software based and are generally called in the main program code to do a specific task. A function is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of outputs.
   * Interrupt service routine - ISR is generally hardware based asynchronous event that can occur any time during the execution of the program. ISR cannot have any arguments that can be passed to it and also cannot return any values.
2. Part of the header file listing with syntax highlighting, which defines settings for Timer/Counter0:

```c
/**
 * @name  Definitions for 8-bit Timer/Counter0
 * @note  t_OVF = 1/F_CPU * prescaler * 2^n where n = 8, F_CPU = 16 MHz
 */
#define TIM0_stop()                         TCCR0B &= ~((1<<CS02) | (1<<CS01) | (1<<CS00));
/** @brief Set overflow 16us, prescaler 001 --> 1 */
#define TIM0_overflow_16us()                TCCR0B &= ~((1<<CS02) | (1<<CS01)); TCCR0B |= (1<<CS00);
/** @brief Set overflow 128us, prescaler 010 --> 8 */
#define TIM0_overflow_128us()               TCCR0B &= ~((1<<CS02) | (1<<CS00)); TCCR0B |= (1<<CS01);
/** @brief Set overflow 1024 us, prescaler 011 --> 64 */
#define TIM0_overflow_1024us()              TCCR0B &= ~(1<<CS02); TCCR0B |= (1<<CS01) | (1<<CS00);
/** @brief Set overflow 4096us, prescaler 100 --> 256 */
#define TIM0_overflow_4096us()              TCCR0B &= ~((1<<CS01) | (1<<CS00)); TCCR0B |= (1<<CS02);
/** @brief Set overflow 16384 us, prescaler // 101 --> 1024 */
#define TIM0_overflow_16384us()             TCCR0B &= ~(1<<CS01); TCCR0B |= (1<<CS02) | (1<<CS00);
/** @brief Enable overflow interrupt, 1 --> enable */
#define TIM0_overflow_interrupt_enable()    TIMSK0 |= (1<<TOIE0);
/** @brief Disable overflow interrupt, 0 --> disable */
#define TIM0_overflow_interrupt_disable()   TIMSK0 &= ~(1<<TOIE0);
```

3. Flowchart figure for function `main()` and interrupt service routine `ISR(TIMER1_OVF_vect)` of application that ensures the flashing of one LED in the timer interruption. When the button is pressed, the blinking is faster, when the button is released, it is slower. Use only a timer overflow and not a delay library.

### Knight Rider

1. Scheme of Knight Rider application with four LEDs and a push button, connected according to Multi-function shield. Connect AVR device, LEDs, resistors, push button, and supply voltage. The image can be drawn on a computer or by hand. Always name all components and their values!
